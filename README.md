# a11y-color-analyzer
More than your usual color contrast analyzer

## Summary
The idea here is that I want to create a color contrast analyzer (like webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker), but I want it to be able to handle more than just one color vs another. I want it to be able to handle alpha channels, input types other than hex, and have options for sliders that do more than grayscale changes to colors.
